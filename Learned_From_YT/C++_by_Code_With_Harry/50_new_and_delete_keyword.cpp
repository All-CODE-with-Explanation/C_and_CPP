/*  new and delete keyword

    Here * means dereferencing the pointer address, so finally after dereferencing it gives value.

    âœ¨ new operator :- The new operator denotes a request for memory allocation on the free store.

    ðŸŸ¢ If sufficient memory is available, new operator initializes the memory and returns the   address of the newly allocated and initialized memory to the pointer variable.

    ðŸ’Š Syntax to use new Operator :
        To allocate the memory of any data type, the syntax is ðŸ‘‡

        pointer-variable = new data-type;
