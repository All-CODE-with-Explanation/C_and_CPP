/*
    An Object is an instance of a Class. When a class is defined, no memory is allocated but when it is instantiated (i.e. an object is created) memory is allocated.

    There are three access modifiers : public, private and protected.

    Note 1 :-  
        Any data memeber or function which is declared without without any access modifier is by default always private.

    There are 2 ways to define a member function:
    1.    Inside class definition
    2.    Outside class definition

            To define a member function outside the class definition we have to use the scope resolution :: operator along with class name and function name.
